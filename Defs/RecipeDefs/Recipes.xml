<RecipeDefs>

	<!-- Recipes are used to transform ingredients into products (or other results like surgery post-states).
	RecipesDefs are independent, which makes them ideal for compatibility, since recipes can also be made in less compatible ways.
	RecipesDefs will generate errors if the ingredients, products, hediffs etc. associated with them are missing (missing mods, missing defs) -->
