# RimWorld XML Database
This repository's goal is to make RimWorld modding easier. We strive to provide easy-to-read files to help everyone understand XML modding.

Feel free to use anything in the repository to help you make, update, modify or do anything relating to mods.

# Folder Structure
* One master file per folder (ex. Recipes.xml) containing a very long XML def. Every line is commented to explain what it does
* One templates file per folder (Templates.txt) containing a few easy-to-copy defs without comments
* One examples file per folder (Examples.xml) containing several complete defs (taken from vanilla and/or mods)

# Contributions
Any contributions are welcome. These are some things we would love to see:
* New master XML files
* Corrections to mistakes in the master XML files
* New templates
* New, useful examples
* Suggestions & questions

# Credits
* **milon** for his extremely useful XML auto-documentation
* **Zhentar** for his fork of ILSpy which is also extremely invaluable to understanding RimWorld code
