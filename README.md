# RimWorld XML Database
My personal attempt at creating an XML database. Forked from RimworldModdingFiles (kaptain_kavern's version) and will eventually make its way there.

# Folder Structure
* Each folder contains at least 1 big commented XML with a set structure.
* Commented XML files are commented as standalone (containing all possible comments, referring as little as possible to other XML files).
* Each folder contains 1 templates txt file. I chose txt because XML throws annoying errors when you try to open or save it if you have certain document editors. The purpose of this file is to provide easy-to-copy templates, not edit.
* Each folder contains at least 1 examples XML, striving to provide diverse examples (can be from mods).
* The goal is to have as few files as possible per folder to minimise confusion.

# Roadmap
* Finish all defs I possibly can.
* Set a good structure for each file and folder: readable, well commented, at least mostly correct. This requires feedback from other modders.
* When all of the folders are done: publish, have users correct mistakes, strive to be the only XML database for maximum participation and accuracy.
