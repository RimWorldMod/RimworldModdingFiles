# RimWorld XML Database
My personal attempt at creating an XML database. Forked from RimworldModdingFiles (kaptain_kavern's version) and will eventually make its way there.
* Each file must contain a pre-determined structure.
* Each file is commented as if it is standalone ("explain like I'm 5", if you will).
* Each file must have blank templates for copying easily, along with a fully documented main def.
* If several defs are very similar, the goal should be to combine them into one mega-def.

# Roadmap
* Finish all defs I possibly can.
* Set a good structure for each XML: readable, with templates.
* Set a good examples.xml for each folder: several diverse fully defined defs.
